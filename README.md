## Tips for Use

- Click and drag off a jack to create a patch cable, drop it on another jack to plug it in.
- Hover over a knob and use your scroll wheel to turn it. If you have a horizontal scroll, you can use that to make fine adjustments.
- Hit the power switch to turn it on!
- Those things in the middle labeled "VCO" are oscillators. They're what actually produce a sound wave.
- The jack labeled "SPEAKER" is connected to your computer's speakers.
- So in short, your signal path will always start with one or more VCOs, and end in the OUT.
- There are other modules that transform the sound, these will have an IN and an OUT.
- Any jack labeled "MOD" lets you modulate a parameter with another signal. Try connecting the outputs of different modules into these.
- Just like in real life, voltage is voltage and you can plug any output into any input.
